# Home-Hub

Home-Hub is a dashboard that shows recent tweets and news stories, along with the weather for today. Planned improvements include more settings, multiple rss feeds, adding dates to rss feeds, better UI for Recent Tweets and more.

*There is no need to run `config.py`, this is just for storing your settings. :)*
